# Packages

>  The module will display a list of created packages, allow a user to create a package, and allow a user to view the information of a specific package by clicking on it.  The user can open up the form to create a package by clicking on `Create New Package`.  Within the form, the user enters a package name, requested quantitites (one or many), a due date, and description/notes.  The user can also select files and then upload them by clicking 'Upload Files'.  To save the package, the user clicks `Save Package`.  The user can see a specific package's details by clicking on the package in the list.  While viewing a package, the user can click on any attachment to download.
